      <p>This app will allow a teacher (that has been logged before) to create a room with a ID and to give it to his students. The students can connect to the room with a given username and once the students are in the room, the teacher can asked a question that will be display to all the student. Before the student has gave a response to the question, he can't see other's response. When he validate his response, all the responses already gave will be display to him and will be refresh in real time to him. He can't change his answer anymore. The teacher can always see all the responses in real time but can also choose to hide them for the moment (If his screen is displaying for all the class for exemple). When the teacher decide to close the question, some statistics will be display to him and he can create a new question.</p>
